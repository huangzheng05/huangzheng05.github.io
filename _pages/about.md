## About me
Currently, I am a a junior undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) (SJTU). My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics, with a focus on Autonomous Driving and Embodied AI. I am particularly passionate about modeling the dynamic 3D world, leveraging deep generative models, representation learning, and multi-modal learning (including language).

## Education

- 2023.9-present, Bachelor of Smart Energy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
- 2020.9-2023.6, High School, [The Affiliated High School of South China Normal University](https://www.hsfz.net.cn/homepage/index.jsp)

## Experience
