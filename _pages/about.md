## About me
Currently, I am a a junior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). My research focuses on computer vision and robotics, with a current emphasis on developing techniques for autonomous
driving. I am particularly interested in modeling the dynamic 3D world, leveraging my background in deep generative
models, representation learning, and multi-modal learning (including language).
